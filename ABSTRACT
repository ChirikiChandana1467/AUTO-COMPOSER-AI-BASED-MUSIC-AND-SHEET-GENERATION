 AI Music Composer system that automates the process of generating, synthesizing, and visualizing musical compositions using Python. It leverages the PrettyMIDI library to algorithmically create MIDI sequences based on configurable musical parameters such as duration, tempo, pitch range, scales, arpeggios, rhythm choices, and melodic smoothness. The generated notes simulate the structure of realistic piano performances, and users have control over musical variation through probabilistic and rule-based methods. 
The system then synthesizes these MIDI files into high-quality WAV audio using FluidSynth and a SoundFont file, ensuring the playback sounds natural and expressive. To provide deeper insight into the composition, a piano roll visualization is rendered using Matplotlib, showing pitch, timing, and velocity data with color-coded intensity, making the dynamics of the music clearly interpretable. 
Furthermore, the system utilizes the Music21 toolkit and LilyPond to convert the MIDI into traditional sheet music in PDF format, allowing musicians to view and perform the composition. All outputs, including the MIDI, WAV, and sheet music PDF files, are downloadable for user convenience. This complete pipeline—from composition to audio playback and sheet music generation—makes the AI Music Composer a comprehensive tool for musicians, educators, and hobbyists interested in algorithmic music generation.
